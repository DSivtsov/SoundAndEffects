BUGs


Additional Checks
1. Add management of GameComplexety to Options and info to Help

Proposals
1. Add to Video Option TurnOff Additional Animation at Collision
2. Customization Character
3. Save Setting from Options to file
4. Add the possibility to set different SequentType for different JukeBox 
5. (--)Add the possibility to set different Volumes for different Scenes

Features
1. In current Time it's a possibile to have the different setting the SequentType for different JukeBox (at "Initial Load" only)
2. The SequentType after changing is stored in assets until next change if it change in Play Editor mode. !!! In Build Play Mode the SO Assets not save the changes at the end Game.

Fix 0.1
"3. PlayJukeBox & PlayJukeBoxCollection can use in one time the Update() cycle to manager Input as result the input command can repeats twice (use the workaround directly turn off the coresponded GameObject when Music not played)"
Made the separate AudioControls script which single point for Get Input, the PlayJukeBox & PlayJukeBoxCollection doesn't use the Update() any more for get Input actions

Fix 0.2
"1. At Start Game in the TopMenu Score 999 999"
Refactoring Management Restart Game
"2. After collision some Obstacle recieve Rotation and stay with it in other Spawned times"
Refactoring "RestoreInitialParametersLastCollisedRigidbody()" additionaly set the initial transfrom rotation of Obstacles

Fix 0.3
"Check spacing for Spawning after restart Game (problem occur time to times)"
Refactoring Spawning - now min distance after added after obstacle mandadory, also corrected spawning first Obstacle and changed the spacing spawning parameters (from int to float)
Additionally the GameComplexety began affect on the Score
Corrected the start of Game scene if it will start alone
Refactoring "RestoreInitialParametersLastCollisedRigidbody()" additionaly corrected the restore of the initial transfrom rotation transfrom rotation of Obstacles (vs use the Quaternion.Identity that is wrong)
