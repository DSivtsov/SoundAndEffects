Fix 0.1
"3. PlayJukeBox & PlayJukeBoxCollection can use in one time the Update() cycle to manager Input as result the input command can repeats twice (use the workaround directly turn off the coresponded GameObject when Music not played)"
Made the separate AudioControls script which single point for Get Input, the PlayJukeBox & PlayJukeBoxCollection doesn't use the Update() any more for get Input actions

Fix 0.2
"1. At Start Game in the TopMenu Score 999 999"
