/*Another option might be to split the class into two parts: a regular static class for the Singleton component,
 * and a MonoBehaviour that acts as a controller for the singleton instance.This way you have full control over the singleton's construction, and it will persist across scenes.
 * This also lets you add controllers to any object that might need the singleton's data, instead of having to dig through the scene to find a particular component.
